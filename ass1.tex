Consider the graph

Removing any edge on the left side will increase the min cut. 
Initially the left-side edges make up $\frac{1}{3}$ of the total amount of edges.
At every stage if the algorithm has not contracted any wrong edge, the probability of contracting a wrong edge is than at least $\frac{1}{3}$. Thus we see that the probability of obtaining the min-cut is at most

$$ \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n-1} $$

Where $n$ is the total number of edges. (This is exponentially decreasing in $n$).
