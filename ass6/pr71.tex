\section*{Problem 7.1}
As observed in the proof of theorem 7.1, the task is equivalent to
computing $P(Mr=0 \ | \ M \neq 0)$. \\
So assume that $M$ is a non-zero $n \times n$ matrix and sample $r=(r_1,\cdots,r_n)^T$
by sampling each entry independently and uniformly from $\left\{ 0,1 \right\}$. \\ \\
Now since $M$ is non-zero, at least one of its row, $M_1,\cdots,M_n$ is non-zero.
Let $M_i$ denote this row.
