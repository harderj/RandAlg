\section*{Pr.3.1}

If $N$ is the random variable of the number of empty bins then
$N = \sum_{i=1}^n N_i$ where $N_i$ is one if bin number $i$ is empty
and zero otherwise. 
Thus by linearity of expectation
$$ E N = \sum_{i=1}^n E N_i = n \cdot \left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^m $$
since every independent $m$ balls have to land in the $n-1$ other bins
If $m = n$ this is $\approx n / e$.
