\section*{Exercise 4.3}

If two routes separate that means that at a common $k$th bit they chose different ways.
This again means that they must have different goals, differing on the $k$th bit.
Since bit correction is going from left to right, these routes will never rejoin, since they will differ on this $k$th bit until their goals are reached.
