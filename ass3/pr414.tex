\section*{Problem 4.14}

Let us look at the sorting tree of some execution of the \emph{RandQS} algorithm on some set $S$.
Say that at some node the algorithm chooses a \emph{good pivot} provided that it selects an element from its given subset $S' \subset S$ that is results in two subsets (elements of higher resp. lower order) with size no larger than $3/4 |S'|$.
We claim that the chance of this selection by the algorithm is at least $1/2$.
