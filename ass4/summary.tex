\subsection*{8.2 Random Treaps}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{treap} is a binary tree with nodes containing pairs of \emph{keys} and \emph{priorities} (distinct numbers) such that it is a
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{full} (all nodes have 0 or 2 children), \emph{endogenous} (values are stored internally) \emph{binary search tree} with respect to the keys (left children has lower keys, right children higher)
  \item \emph{heap} with respect to the priorities (paths to the root are decreasing in the priorities)
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
